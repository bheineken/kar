Just discovered I have a hard copy of [Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) & [Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) 2nd edition and started to read it. Then I decided to make this repository to put all the exercises in the book here. Never programmed in C (did some C++ in late 90's) but here we go.
